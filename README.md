## Interactive Electoral Map of Georgia Counties: Visualizing Democratic â€œFlippability"
This projects visualizes the Democratic strength of Georgia counties on an interactive map that displays county information in a hover box. 

### Tech Used
Google Spreadsheets was used in the data collection and analysis process. Tableau was used to create the color map. The end result was published to Tableau Public. 

### Structure of the Code
Our team collected an extensive amount of Georgia vote count data at various levels. The result served as the base data set to which new data was joined and off of which visualization was created.

The geometrical data was available within Tableau. 

The interactive map was created using Tableau.

### Installation
Download Tableau from its website in order to view the color map file locally on your desktop. Alternatively, no installation is needed to view the Tableau color map online via [public.tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/views/GeorgiaCountiesDemocraticStrengthColorMap/ColorMap-byDStrength?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
