## Interactive Electoral Map of Georgia Counties: Visualizing Democratic “Flippability"
This projects visualizes the Democratic strength of Georgia counties on an interactive map that displays county information in a hover box. 

### Tech Used
R is the only programming language used in creating the color map. The end result is saved to a .html format. 

### Structure of the Code
Our team collected an extensive amount of Georgia vote count data at various levels. The result served as the base data set to which new data was joined and off of which visualization was created.

The geometrical data was obtained through accessing Georgia’s Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code through the tigris package within R.

The interactive map was created using the plotly R package.

### Installation
Be sure to install any packages you don’t already have in your R environment. All necessary packages have been included in the body of the code.

### Running the Application
After installing your packages, simply run the entirety of the code starting from loading the various packages, to the last line which saves the interactive map to .html.
