## Flippability Score and Democratic Strength Computation Explanations

For the purpose of our analysis, we computed Democratic strength, a metric expressed as a percentage that measures the level of partisan strength of the Democratic Party given the election results within a given political subdivision (i.e. county, state senate district, state house district, etc.).

In order to determine Democratic strength, we first collected election results for the last three election cycles for each political subdivision; we gathered the following data: 

<LI>County-level presidential election results to compute Democratic strength of each county
<LI>Congressional district-level presidential election results to compute Democratic strength of each congressional district
<LI>State Senate election results to compute Democratic strength of each State Senate district
<LI>State House election results to compute Democratic strength of each State House district
<LI>District Attorney election results to compute Democratic strength of each judicial circuit


To calculate Democratic strength, we computed the average of the two-party vote for each political subdivision as follows:

</script>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = \frac{a}{b} + c^2 + d\]</span></p>

Using Democratic strength, we then created a flippability score, which is a measure that determines the likelihood of flipping a political subdivision from Republican to Democratic control, ranging from 1 as the least flippable to 6 and the most flippable.

Political subdivisions already currently under Democratic control are denoted as 0 on the flippability scale.

## Color Map Display Explanation
 
On our color map, the flippability score is translated with the intensity (pale to dark) of the purple color of each political area subdivision.

## Spreadsheet Calculations Explained
 <OL>
<LI>To calculate if a given political area subdivision currently already has a Democarat in office, we used the following: 
<UL>
<LI>IF() function, = IF(J2 > K2, 1, 0)
<LI>where, J2 is a cell within the column listing the # of Democratic votes 
<LI>where, K2 is a cell within the column listing the # of Republican votes 
<LI>Conditional Statement used: insert latex statement 
</UL>
<LI>To calculate the democratic strength of a given political area subdivision, we used the following: 
<UL>
<LI>SUM()function to compute the arithmetic mean, =sum(M2, U2, Q2, I2)/4
<LI>M2, U2, Q2, I2 are all cells within the columns listing the expression below for each respective election cycle
<LI>Expression: 
</UL>
 <LI>Next, we computed the flippability score. To do this, a more complex conditional using the IF() function is needed, which corresponds to the table listed above **say which section it is listed in!**
<UL>
<LI>=IF(C2 = 1, 0, IF(D2 < 34.99, 1, IF(D2 < 39.99, 2 ,IF(D2 < 44.99, 3, IF(D2 < 47.49, 4, IF(D2 < 49.99, 5, 6))))))
<LI>"C2" is a cell within the column which lists a 0 if the current political office is held by a Republican and a 1 if it is otherwise held by a Democrat  
<LI>D2 is a cell in the column listing the Democratic Strength 
</UL>

## Top 20 Most Flippable Counties List 
Given the above calculations performed on Georgia counties for the 2016 (Clinton and Trump ) and 2020 (Biden and Trump) presidential elections, the 2018 midterm gubernatorial elections (Abrams and Kemp), and the 2021 U.S. Senate Runoff election (Ossoff and Perdue), a list of the top 20 counties with the highest flippability scores are listed below:
