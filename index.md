# Technology Accessibility and Educational Attainment: Case Study in Alabama
Pamela, Cassandra, and Rena

## Background
The Covid-19 pandemic has strengthened our reliance on technology in education, replacing traditional classroom functions such as lecture, exams, assignments, office hours, and others with alternatives online using video conferencing tools or online learning software, like Blackboard<sup>1</sup>.

Since March 2019, when campuses closed due to rising Covid-19 cases, colleges nationwide have scrambled to transition to online learning<sup>2</sup>. Class lectures have become synchronous and asynchronous, live on Zoom or recorded. Assignments and exams are also completed and submitted on third-party websites like BlackBoard or Gradescope. Even as the classroom adapts to hybrid modes as Covid-19 regulations ease, all these technologies still remain vital to classroom functions regardless. In K-12 schools,  many children all experience similar impacts of technology in their classrooms. Children as young as 5-year old take their seats in front of their computer to participate in classes online via Zoom. Middle and High school students have moved most of their classroom functions online as well.

However, ever before this pandemic, technology has already spread its roots into our education system. In all subjects taught in school, technology has been used to supplement in-class lectures. In a language class, one might find themselves consulting Google Translate or another online translator. In a math class, one might find themselves searching in Stack Overflow for the answers to their Linear Algebra questions. In a Science class, one might have dumped their Organic Chemistry compounds into a Quizlet to make flashcards to study with. On team assignments, students may have corresponded through Messenger, Email, or GroupMe and collaborated on Google Drive. Grades were also updated online . It’s difficult, but not impossible, to imagine the alternatives for all these technologies in an in-person classroom setting.

While this shift has provided more flexibility to people from different backgrounds and time zones, this has changed technology from being a supplement to education in the classroom to a necessity as some classroom operations have been strictly online. It is increasingly harder to accommodate those who do not have access to Zoom meetings or paid training modules. According to the Federal Communications Commission, “broadband availability has been at the heart of the digital divide with an estimated 21.3 million people lacking access in 2019”. Although the digital gap between urban and rural communities is narrowing, the connectivity of households in the rural areas is still below the average (only two-thirds of rural Americans reported a home broadband connection).

The lack of internet access has left many low-income, school-age disadvantaged in completing assignments and other school-related activities as compared to their high-income counterparts in a phenomenon coined by FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called “homework gap”<sup>3</sup>.

As such, it is clear to see how important access to technology such as the internet has become to education attainment.  Therefore, for this project, we would like to investigate the relationship between access to technology and  education attainment.

For our investigation, we decided to focus on Alabama for the following reasons: large differences in tech access and enrollment across the counties and the tech accessibility initiatives in certain counties.

For example, in the following graph, we can start to observe how sporadic the counties are in terms of internet access and education attainment.

Although tech accessibility initiatives are not ubiquitous in all Alabama, there has been some, such as the one in called “One Laptop per Child” in  Birmingham, AL 2012  where “…some 15,000 of the group’s XO laptops were distributed to all first- through fifth-grade public school students and their teachers”<sup>4</sup>. We further narrow our scope to three Alabama counties, Montgomery, Jefferson (where Birmingham is located), and Mobile, because all three are ranked differently from most educated to least educated counties


## Infogram Interactive Graph Visualizations and Analysis

The data visualized on the Infogram interactive graph slide deck comes from the American Community Survey.

1. Across years 2013-2019 for each of the chosen three counties using the 1 year survey.

2. Across all counties in Alabama for just year 2017 using the 5 year survey. 

To quantify our chosen issue of internet accessibility and educational success, the relevant census data outcome labels we found were 
- a breakdown of internet access types (# households with an internet subscription, # households with internet access but no subscription, # households with no internet access)
- % population 25 or older with high school diploma

To better understand the three Alabama counties we chose, we first explored background statistics. Despite choosing them initially for their diversity of educational achievement in the three counties, the proportions of the population with different internet access types are relatively similar and the percentage of the population 25 or older with high school diploma across the three counties is relatively similar. Montgomery County, out of the three, is the only majority black county, and does have the lowest proportion of the population with a high school diploma, at 13.4%, but as mentioned above, does not differ significantly in internet access.

Jefferson County, where the Birmingham laptop to students initiative occurred in 2012, did not seem to have a significant per capita difference in educational attainment or internet access. The fact that technology accessibility, however, is complicated and involves internet access as well as laptop device access, may explain why educational attainment did not improve significantly. Simply mass distributing laptops to students and teachers is not enough if household internet access is not readily available.

Trends in the changes in internet access in Alabama from 2013 to 2019 also unfortunately do not seem to differ significantly across each of the three counties. Very unusually, the number of households without internet access spikes for all three counties in 2015, but then slowly decreases in years after, while the number of households with internet access has been slowly increasing for all counties over the years.

Looking at educational attainment and internet access across Alabama overall for all counties in 2017 normalized for percentage of the population (slide 5 of 5), there is unfortunately not a lot of patterns to be drawn either.
