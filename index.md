## Flippability Score and Democratic Strength Computation Explanations

For the purpose of our analysis, we computed Democratic strength, a metric expressed as a percentage that measures the level of partisan strength of the Democratic Party given the election results within a given political subdivision (i.e. county, state senate district, state house district, etc.).

In order to determine Democratic strength, we first collected election results for the last three election cycles for each political subdivision; we gathered the following data: 
<OL START=”1″>
<LI>County-level presidential election results to compute Democratic strength of each county
<LI>Congressional district-level presidential election results to compute Democratic strength of each congressional district
<LI>State Senate election results to compute Democratic strength of each State Senate district
 <LI>State House election results to compute Democratic strength of each State House district
 <LI>District Attorney election results to compute Democratic strength of each judicial circuit
